# TwoPointChargeElectrodynamics
Matlab Script that shows the dynamics of two point charges


The aim of this script is to evaluate with classical electrodynamics the final velocity for point-like charges approaching in frontal or almost frontal direction, while measuring the amount of energy radiated by the charges due to Larmor radiation.

Two simulations are highlighted: the approximation of a light particle to an at rest massive particle (with same charge and sign) and the 100% frontal approximation of two particles with equal mass and charge and opposite velocity.

In the first case, the light particle is reflected or diverted keeping the same initial energy, while the massive particle remains in rest. In the second case each of the particles is repelled taking a little more speed than the initial.

The reason why the kinetical energy does not increase in the first case but does it in the second is because of the energy of the radiated field at long distances. In the first scenario, the radiated field energy at long distances is the same than the Larmor formula because only one particle is accelerating, so there are no interferences between the radiated fields from each particle. On the other hand, in the second case the radiated field in the long distance is the sum of two contributions quite opposed, since each charge is accelerating with equal magnitude but opposite direction so the radiated field energy in the long distance is near zero.

These results demonstrate that a device like the Abraham-Lorentz reaction force or similar is necessary to preserve the total energy in the system.
